(!) AGED AMAZON ACCOUNT ORDERING METHOD:
BEFORE ORDERING ANYTHING:

1: Add the Store Card by Credit or Debit Card here (https://www.amazon.com/cpe/managepayment...l_pmt_mpo&), Name has to be the same as the Amazon Account Name, Leave Expiration Date as default (or set to 02/20 if needed). If the card was over $40 (my price) I provide you with a billing address, if not go to the very bottom of this method, to optional step #3, and use your real phone number.
2: Wait the full time of 24 Hours. This is a key component of actually getting the full balance to work. It is buyers expense if the card no longer works if method is not followed.
3: Make sure your first purchase is under $150. If it is, Amazon will get a alert and probably lock your account. They don't like big purchases out of no where.
4: Classify all products you are purchasing as a gift. This is so you will not get billed. They will not bill a gift recipient.
5: Order products one by one. Wait until the product you order ships, til you order the next one.
6: Order all products on the same device, using the same IP/Proxy. If Amazon sees different IP's, then they will automatically lock your account and cancel your order. Keep your default account settings.
7: Delivery Address: Use all of your real info including the phone number. Amazon might call you to confirm the order. If you don't answer the call, Amazon will automatically cancel your order. If you miss the call, that is your fault.
8: Don't constantly check if your order is still there. It is. Amazon logs how many times you check your orders. They will get suspicous if you're constantly checking your orders. You will get email updates anyway.
9: If you are getting a refund, please go to Customer Service and ask for the refund to go to Gift Card Balance. This will make sure you keep the money if the card gets locked other wise.
10: Omg yes, the card has limits. Your account will get temp-locked if you go crazy.
11: If Amazon asks you to finance. SAY NO.






(!) NEW AMAZON ACCOUNT METHOD:
THIS CAN/WILL TAKE AROUND 3 DAYS
Make sure you DO NOT use a VPN, this will 100% get you locked...

REGISTER AT AMAZON.COM:
1. Let's make a new amazon account, register at amazon.com
2. Once it's registered go to "Your Account" then "Manage Addresses", you'll now need to add a shipping address (the address you need your stuff shipped to),now you need to search through amazon, add things to cart, remove them, get amazon use to your ip. Once you finish, sign out and leave it for 24 hours.
3. After 24 hours, log back into your amazon, then link the card as a DEBIT/CREDIT Card, you'll need to check the "Use name on Account" (or just put the name that's on your account), enter the card number I sent you and the billing address (only applys to cards over $4k) if not go to the very bottom of this method, to optionals step.
4. Once that's done, sign back into the account (2-3 times, not all at once), you need to search up things on amazon, add things to cart, remove things, etc... Once you've done that again, log out of the account and wait another 12-36 hours (NOT OPTIONAL).
5. After the 12-36 hours, log back in and buy a smaller item ($10-$100) (MARK THESE ITEMS AS A GIFT!!!!), once that item has shipped (preferably not as soon as it ships), you can then order another item (2x the price of the first item), and continue doing this and work your way up.
6. Once you receive and/or use all the money on the card, if you don't want another card I do suggest maybe deleting/deactivating the account, this isn't necessary just is an option as it'll be harder for them to bill you.





(!) CRACKED AMAZON ACCOUNT METHOD:
1. Depending on if you have/had multiple accounts on your IP, you might want to get a vps! This isn't an rdp, but it is basically a computer you remotely connect too. If you need one, visit here and choose the $6.99 plan https://pivps.com/windows-vps/ NOTE: This is not in any way necessary!
2. Login to the Amazon Account at amazon.com. Once you're in go to the email address and delete any emails associated with you logging in.
3. DO NOT CHANGE THE PASSWORD! This will flag the account & most likely get you locked out. Go ahead and add the billing address (go to options at the bottom of this txt to find it) in the "my address" tab.
4. You need to look around amazon, search things, add things to cart, etc... Let the bots recognize you. Once this is done log out and wait 12 hours.
5. After waiting your 12 hours, log back in and go to the payment options tab. Once you're here, go to link a debit/credit card and link your card with the name on the account! Use the card number, leave the exp date (or change to 02/20) and set the billing address as the one you set before!
6. After linking, go ahead and search around, add things to cart, etc for another few minutes then sign back out and wait 12 more hours.
7. Once you've waited 12 hours, log back in, add your real shipping address in the "your addresses tab", once you're done, search around, add things to cart, etc... Log out and wait 6-12 hours.
8. Now we're on the final step, log back in for the last time, go ahead and find the item you want (under 150-200$), and checkout. Make sure to use the store card (DO NOT USE ACCOUNT OWNERS CARD), set the item as a gift, use your real shipping addy, and checkout.
Hopefully it works :)





(!) AMAZONPAY METHOD:
1. First, link your card to your account, I suggest waiting 2-12 hours (the longer the better) before purchasing.
2. Go to any site accepting AmazonPay, find the item you are interested in, and go ahead and sign up for an account.
3. Once you signup, add your item to your cart then go to checkout.
4. Once you get to the payment options, choose "AmazonPay" and sign into your amazon with the card that you used. Once you've signed in choose the card as the payment method and place your order.

Cautions:
If the website says payment failed, do NOT try it again, leave it for a hour or two and try again later. This is often caused by the account being bad, locked, or not aged.
When you go to checkout, and the payment options are greyed out, this means that either the amount is too big for the payment options, or they are not supported, try a lower amount or a different item.

OPTIONALS:
Go to https://www.randomlists.com/random-addresses and get a random U.S. address. You know want to go to maps.google.com put in the address, then press enter (it will say invalid but click the first suggestion). You then want to switch to satelite view, then street view and find a random house, NOT A BUSINESS/STORE, then use that as your billing.

(!) ACCOUNT LOCKED:
1. If they email you saying that someone might have accessed your account and they'll be changing your password and such, wait till it's back up (usually within 2 hours) then you need to change pass, log out, then wait another 6 hours before linking the card again and resuming at step #4.
2. If your account still get's locked (it happens, there's multiple reasons and it will never work 100%) don't freak out, just call them and tell them to delete the account and start this process over. The card will still work!





(!) ONCE AMAZON UNLOCKS YOUR ACCOUNT:
1. Call Amazon saying that you will be ordering the next couple products.
2. Age the card out a bit. 12-24 Hours. (Not needed but recommended).
Use this file in case of a account lock! Edit in PhotoShop, use the info you used for your account!
Statement Editable File: https://www.mediafire.com/file/113z0wkik...t.psd/file
3. Edit the Name, Billing Address, and card number. All these need to be in ALL CAPS!
4. Once you're done and it looks half decent, save it as a PDF file and submit it! </p>
